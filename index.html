              <h2>Life</h2>
              <br>
         <p>George Kusunoki Miller, known as Joji, is a Japanese-Australian singer-songwriter, record producer, and former YouTube personality. 
            During his time at YouTube between 2008 and 2017, he mainly produced humorous content. He also posted critical songs and videos. 
            One of his videos was the origin of the meme "Harlem Shake", by music producer Baauer, who was responsible for the song's debut at the top of the Billboard Hot 100.
